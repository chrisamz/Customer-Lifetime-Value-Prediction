# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the future value of customers based on their purchase history and behavior. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a critical metric for businesses as it helps in understanding the long-term value of customers and aids in making informed decisions regarding marketing, sales, and customer service strategies. This project demonstrates skills in regression models, survival analysis, cohort analysis, feature engineering, and various other machine learning and data science techniques.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to customer transactions, demographics, and behavior. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Transactional data, customer profiles, web analytics data.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, feature engineering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into customer behavior and purchase history.

- **Techniques Used:** Data visualization, summary statistics, correlation analysis, cohort analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Create new features that capture customer behavior and interaction with the business, such as purchase frequency, average order value, recency, and tenure.

- **Techniques Used:** Aggregation, transformation, encoding categorical variables.

### 4. Regression Models
Develop and evaluate regression models to predict customer lifetime value.

- **Techniques Used:** Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R^2).

### 5. Survival Analysis
Use survival analysis techniques to model customer churn and retention, which are crucial for accurate CLV prediction.

- **Techniques Used:** Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazards model, log-rank test.

### 6. Cohort Analysis
Analyze customer cohorts to understand retention rates, customer behavior over time, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

- **Techniques Used:** Cohort table creation, retention rate calculation, cohort visualization.

### 7. Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model to a production environment for real-time CLV prediction and integrate it with business systems.

- **Techniques Used:** Model saving/loading, API development, deployment strategies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer_lifetime_value_prediction.git
   cd customer_lifetime_value_prediction
   
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
### Data Preparation

1. Place raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    
### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    
2. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess data, perform EDA, engineer features, develop models, conduct survival analysis, and perform cohort analysis:
 - data_preprocessing.ipynb
 - exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
 - feature_engineering.ipynb
 - regression_models.ipynb
 - survival_analysis.ipynb

    python src/survival_analysis.py
    
### Results and Evaluation

 - Regression Model Performance: Evaluate the regression models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R^2. Analyze the model coefficients and feature importance to understand the drivers of customer lifetime value.
 - Survival Analysis: Use survival analysis techniques to model customer churn and retention. Evaluate the survival models using metrics such as concordance index and log-rank test.
 - Cohort Analysis: Analyze customer cohorts to understand retention rates, customer behavior over time, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Visualize cohort retention curves and other key metrics.
   
### Model Deployment

Deploy the trained model to a production environment for real-time CLV prediction. Integrate the model with business systems to enable data-driven decision-making.

1. Save the trained model:
    ```bash
    python src/model_deployment.py --save_model
